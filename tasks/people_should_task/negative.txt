put off deadlines
draw on furniture
arrive late
leave dishes in the sink
be late to appointments
drive through red lights
hit other people
boast about money
text while driving
act without thinking
tell lies
cheat on a test
block an empty seat
talk during movies
use plastic forks
ignore current events
lie to friends
judge others
talk over another person
go to work sick
run with scissors 
talk loudly on the phone
speed while driving
drive too close together
write in library books
text in meetings
bike on the sidewalk
bike without helmets
get tattoos 
play loud music
carve initials in trees
