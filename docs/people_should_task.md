# An fMRI Localizer Task for Deliberative Counterarguing


## Stimuli

### Generic task

The stimuli consist of 70 non-threatening normative statements that all begin with 'People should' (e.g. People should do the crossword) (see Table 1 for the full list of statements). 

Stimuli were pre-testing using Amazon MTurk to determine the extent to which participants agreed or disagreed 
with the statement and the ease or difficulty to which participants could actively generate reasons in favor or reasons against these statements. For example, given the statement _People should vote in local elections_, a reason such as voting is a civic duty would be counted as a reason in favor of the statement whereas only national elections matter would be an example of a reason against the statement. For each statement, we calculated a difference score, in which we subtracted the number of against reasons from the number of in favor reasons. Thus, a positive score indicates that participants had an easier time generating in favor over against reasons, a negative score suggests that participants had an easier time generating against reasons over in favor, and a 0 score indicates that participants generated an equal number of in favor and against reasons.

## Generic counter arguing task

The task consists if 3 within-subject conditions (see Figures 1 & 2). 

* In condition 1 (IN FAVOR), participants are presented with the normative statements and asked to generate reasons in favor of the statement and press a button as they thought of each reason (Figure 1a). 

* In condition 2 (AGAINST), participants are asked to generate reasons against the statements, with an accompanying button press (Figure 1b). 

* Finally, in condition 3 (AGREE), participants are asked to indicate whether they agree or disagree with the statement (Figure 2).

Each trial started with a prompt indicating which task participants had to perform (e.g., condition 1: _Starting the IN FAVOR condition_; condition 3: _Starting the AGREE condition_) for 3 seconds. In the two deliberative conditions, participants were then shown one statement for 12 seconds,  Participants either indicated, via a button press, the number of in favor/against reasons for each statement (in conditions 1 and 2) or the extent to which they agreed/disagreed with each statement (condition 3). This was then followed by a fixation cross for either 2 seconds or 12 seconds every fourth trial.

Conditions 1 and 2 each had 10 trials whereas condition 3 had 30 trials. Each condition had an equal number of easy in favor and easy against statements (i.e., conditions 1 and 2 each had 5 easy in favor and 5 easy against, condition 3 had 15 easy in favor and 15 easy against statements). The order of the three conditions were randomly presented to each participant.



## Data modeling and analysis


Data were modeled using fixed-effects general linear models for each participant as implemented in SPM8, using SPMâ€™s canonical difference of gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF). The six rigid-body translation and rotation parameters derived from spatial realignment were also included as nuisance regressors in all first-level models. Data were high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 128. In study 1, three trial types were modeled: 1. quick judgement (referred to as the AGREE condition), 2. deliberative pro-argumentation (IN FAVOR condition) and 3. deliberative counter-arguing (AGAINST condition). For conditions 2 and 3 two additional regressors where added using the number of button presses (i.e. arguments generated) as what SPM terms _parametric modulators_.  In study 2, the two deliberative conditions (IN FAVOR and AGAINST) were modeled, along with two further regressors incorporating the number of arguments generated, as in study 1 models. Fixation trials were not modeled and constituted an implicit baseline. The six rigid-body translation and rotation parameters derived from spatial realignment were also included as nuisance regressors. Data were high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 128s.
